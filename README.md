### What is g.bims?

g.bims stands for "graph based intelligent music shuffling".
The idea behind this project is to arrange different genres of music in a graph and use
different graph algorithms, such as path finding, A* search, random walks etc. to generate
intelligent playlists.

### How was the graph generated?

As of right now the graph only includes metal subgenres.
The graph has been created in a way to resemble the "Map of Metal",
created by Patrick Galbraith (https://mapofmetal.com/, http://www.pjgalbraith.com/).
